## 1. Quick Start — Simulator Only (no hardware)

Run the full digital twin pipeline on any laptop. No XIAO board, no Renode, no embedded toolchain needed.

```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone <repo-url> gait_device
cd gait_device

# Install Python dependencies
pip install numpy scipy streamlit plotly bleak pyserial pytest pandas pyarrow

# Launch the Digital Twin UI
streamlit run simulator/app.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser. Select a walker profile, click **Run Simulation**.

**What you can do without hardware:**
- Simulate 4 terrain profiles (flat, poor device fit, stairs, inclined surface)
- Toggle **"Simulate gait asymmetry (SI ≈ 25%)"** to inject a clinically significant asymmetry and verify detection
- Toggle **"Show algorithm comparison"** to overlay the original dual-confirmation algorithm (dashed) against the terrain-aware algorithm (solid) — the stair profile shows the original algorithm's failure mode
- Vary step count and random seed for reproducibility

---

## 2. Firmware Build

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install platformio
```

PlatformIO will download the nRF Connect SDK and arm-zephyr-eabi GCC toolchain on first build (~2–3 GB, takes several minutes).

---

### 2a. Simulation build — for Renode digital twin (primary validated path)

> **Important:** PlatformIO's `pio run` command alone does not link the application code into the final ELF. A two-step ninja invocation is required (see [BUG-005](#bug-005-platformio-elf-omits-app-code--two-step-ninja-fix)). This is the only confirmed working build procedure.

```bash
# Step 1 — configure and generate build system
pio run -e xiaoble_sense_sim

# Step 2 — enter the build directory and build in the correct order
cd .pio/build/xiaoble_sense_sim
touch build.ninja                        # force CMake to skip re-generation
ninja app/libapp.a && ninja zephyr/zephyr.elf

# Step back to repo root
cd ../../..
```

**Output ELF:** `.pio/build/xiaoble_sense_sim/zephyr/zephyr.elf`

Expected sizes (from confirmed build 2026-03-27):
- Flash: ~37.4 KB / 1 MB (3.6%)
- SRAM: ~118 KB / 256 KB (45.2%)

If the sizes deviate significantly, the app code may not have linked. Re-run the two-step procedure.

---

### 2b. Production build — for flashing to physical hardware (BLE export)

```bash
pio run -e xiaoble_sense
```

This build enables BLE GATT export. Snapshots are delivered as GATT notifications. Use `host_tool/download_session.py` to download sessions over BLE.

> **Note:** The production build (`xiaoble_sense`) has not been separately validated on hardware as of the last simulation session (2026-03-28). The simulation build (`xiaoble_sense_sim`) is the fully validated path. For hardware bring-up, build `xiaoble_sense` but cross-check behaviour against the simulation predictions in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

---

### 2c. CONFIG_GAIT_UART_EXPORT — Renode binary export flag

The simulation environment cannot run BLE. A build flag activates a UART binary dump in place of the GATT service:

```bash
# Sim build with binary UART export (used internally by Renode bridge)
pio run -e xiaoble_sense_sim   # prj_sim.conf sets CONFIG_GAIT_UART_EXPORT=y
```

**What changes with `CONFIG_GAIT_UART_EXPORT=y`:**

`ble_gait_svc.c` is excluded. At session end, `session_mgr.c` calls `uart_export_snapshots()` which emits:

```
BLE_BINARY_START
<hex-encoded rolling_snapshot_t structs, one per line, 36 hex chars each>
BLE_BINARY_END
SESSION_END steps=N
```

`rolling_snapshot_t` struct layout (18 bytes — **not 20**, see [BUG-012](#bug-012-rolling_snapshot_t-struct-size-comment-wrong)):

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t anchor_step_index;   // 4 bytes
    uint32_t anchor_ts_ms;        // 4 bytes
    uint16_t si_stance_x10;       // 2 bytes  (value × 10, e.g. 123 = 12.3%)
    uint16_t si_swing_x10;        // 2 bytes
    uint16_t si_peak_angvel_x10;  // 2 bytes
    uint16_t mean_cadence_x10;    // 2 bytes
    uint8_t  step_count;          // 1 byte
    uint8_t  flags;               // 1 byte  (0x01=walking, 0x02=running)
} rolling_snapshot_t;             // total: 18 bytes
```

Python unpack (in `simulator/signal_analysis.py`):
```python
SNAPSHOT_STRUCT = struct.Struct("<IIHHHHBB")   # 18 bytes
```

**Do not flash `CONFIG_GAIT_UART_EXPORT=y` firmware to a real device.** It disables BLE entirely.

---

## 3. Unit Tests

### Python simulator tests

```bash
pytest simulator/tests/
```

Expected: **151 tests, all pass**.

### Firmware native tests (no hardware, no Renode)

The native test suite uses plain `assert()`, not Unity — so `pio test -e native` does **not** discover them automatically. Compile and run directly:

```bash
# From repo root
gcc -DUNIT_TEST \
    -I test/native/stubs \
    -I src/gait \
    test/native/test_step_detector.c src/gait/step_detector.c \
    -lm -o /tmp/test_step_detector && /tmp/test_step_detector

gcc -DUNIT_TEST \
    -I test/native/stubs \
    -I src/gait \
    test/native/test_rolling_window.c src/gait/rolling_window.c \
    -lm -o /tmp/test_rolling_window && /tmp/test_rolling_window

gcc -DUNIT_TEST \
    -I test/native/stubs \
    -I src/gait \
    test/native/test_foot_angle.c src/gait/foot_angle.c \
    -lm -o /tmp/test_foot_angle && /tmp/test_foot_angle
```

Expected: 3 tests per suite, all pass. The stub at `test/native/stubs/logging/log.h` defines `#define printk printf` so the firmware logging calls compile against the host GCC.

---

## 4. Digital Twin UI

```bash
streamlit run simulator/app.py
```

Four panels:
1. **Symmetry Index Over Time** — all 4 walker profiles overlaid against the 10% clinical threshold
2. **Algorithm Comparison** *(toggle)* — terrain-aware (solid) vs original dual-confirmation (dashed)
3. **Raw Sensor Signal** — acc_z and gyr_y for the selected profile with detected step markers
4. **Gait Phase Timing** — stance/swing duration bars per step; orange = mounting alert
5. **Profile Summary** — biomechanical parameters and detection statistics

### Renode path (pre-built ELF included — no toolchain required)

A validated pre-built firmware ELF is committed at `firmware/zephyr_sim_2026-03-28.elf`. This is the BUG-013-fixed build confirmed against all 4 profiles in both healthy and pathological modes (2026-03-28). You do not need to install PlatformIO or the nRF Connect SDK to run the Renode digital twin.

```bash
# Install Renode (macOS)
brew install --cask renode

# Launch UI — the pre-built ELF is detected automatically
streamlit run simulator/app.py
```

The bridge searches for the ELF in this order: `firmware/zephyr_sim_2026-03-28.elf` → `.pio/build/.../zephyr/zephyr.elf` (if you have built locally) → fallback. If Renode is installed and the ELF is found, the "Validate on embedded firmware" toggle appears in the sidebar automatically.

If you later build your own ELF (see Section 2a), the locally-built version takes precedence over the pre-built one.

---

## 5. Hardware Deployment

> **Stage gate:** Do not proceed to hardware until all simulation exit criteria in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) Stage 3 are confirmed met. As of 2026-03-28, Stage 3 is complete. Stage 4 (edge cases) is open.

### 5a. Flash firmware

**Option A — drag-and-drop (no tools required):**
1. Double-press the XIAO reset button → it appears as a USB mass storage device (`XIAO-SENSE`)
2. Copy `.pio/build/xiaoble_sense/zephyr/zephyr.uf2` to the drive
3. Device reboots automatically

**Option B — nrfjprog via J-Link (recommended for bring-up):**
```bash
nrfjprog --program .pio/build/xiaoble_sense/zephyr/zephyr.elf --sectorerase
nrfjprog --reset
```

### 5b. Bench bring-up checklist

Run these checks before attaching the device to a subject. Each item maps to a simulation prediction.

| Step | What to check | Expected | How to check |
|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | WHO_AM_I register | `0x6A` on I2C | RTT log line: `imu: WHO_AM_I=0x6A` at boot |
| 2 | FIFO watermark interval | ~154 ms | RTT timestamps between `imu_reader: batch` lines: 32 samples ÷ 208 Hz = 153.8 ms |
| 3 | Calibration | acc_z ≈ 9.81 m/s², gyro bias < 10 mdps/axis | Stand still 2 s after boot; check RTT calibration log |
| 4 | Step count | ≥ 98/100 steps | Walk exactly 100 steps; BLE session summary `total_steps` |
| 5 | Symmetry Index (healthy) | SI < 5% | Natural walking baseline; BLE snapshot SI values |
| 6 | Symmetry Index (lift test) | SI 8–15% | Place 10 mm lift under one heel; walk 100 steps |
| 7 | Sleep current | ≤ 5 μA | Nordic PPK2 between battery and device during idle |
| 8 | Active current | ≤ 1.5 mA | Nordic PPK2 during a walking session |

### 5c. Download a session (BLE)

```bash
pip install bleak
python host_tool/download_session.py --output session_001.csv
```

The tool connects to the first GaitSense device found, subscribes to snapshot notifications, writes `anchor_step`, `si_stance`, `si_swing`, `cadence` columns to CSV.

### Critical bugs for hardware validator to know

#### BUG-005: PlatformIO ELF omits app code — two-step ninja fix

**Symptom:** `pio run -e xiaoble_sense_sim` completes without error but the generated `zephyr.elf` contains only the Zephyr kernel — all `src/` application files are missing. Firmware boots but detects 0 steps and emits no SNAPSHOT lines.

**Root cause:** PlatformIO's CMake invocation links against a pre-built stub `app/libapp.a` rather than rebuilding it from sources. The stub is empty on a clean build.

**Fix:** Two-step ninja build (see [Section 2a](#2a-simulation-build--for-renode-digital-twin-primary-validated-path)):
```bash
pio run -e xiaoble_sense_sim
cd .pio/build/xiaoble_sense_sim && touch build.ninja
ninja app/libapp.a && ninja zephyr/zephyr.elf
```

**How to verify the fix worked:** ELF flash size should be ~37.4 KB. If it is < 5 KB, the app code is missing.

---

#### BUG-010: Stair walker — 0/100 steps detected (terrain algorithm failure)

**Symptom:** All 4 walker profiles detect 100/100 steps on flat, slope, and poor fit. Stair walker detects 0 steps.

**Root cause:** The original dual-confirmation step detector requires an acc_filt peak and a gyr_y zero-crossing within 40 ms of each other. On flat ground these are co-incident (heel-strike drives both). On stairs, forefoot/midfoot contact separates them by 135 ms — the step is always rejected on timing.

**Fix:** Option C terrain-aware detector — push-off plantar-flexion burst (gyr_y_hp > 30 dps) becomes the primary trigger; acc_filt > adaptive threshold since last step is the confirmation. An 8-entry ring buffer stores rejected acc_filt crossings so the retrospective heel-strike timestamp is recovered. Push-off is biomechanically universal across all terrains.

**Files changed:** `src/gait/step_detector.c`, `simulator/terrain_aware_step_detector.py`

**Verified:** All 4 profiles 100/100 steps in bare-metal Cortex-M4F simulation.

---

#### BUG-013: VABS.F32 broken in Renode 1.16.1 — SI silently zeroed

**Symptom:** Pathological walker (true SI = 25%) reports SI = 0.0% across all 9 snapshots in Renode. Healthy walkers unaffected (correct answer is 0% regardless).

**Root cause:** `compute_si_x10()` in `rolling_window.c` calls `fabsf(m_odd - m_even)`. The ARM FPU instruction `VABS.F32` returns the wrong result (~0) in Renode 1.16.1 when the input is a computed FPU-register value. Same class of emulator bug as the previously documented `VSQRT.F32` failure in `step_detector.c`.

**Why this matters:** The SI output is the only clinical signal the device produces. A silently zeroed SI means the device reports "perfect symmetry" for every patient regardless of actual gait asymmetry — a dangerous false negative that would have shipped to hardware undetected without the pathological walker test.

**Fix:** Replaced `fabsf()` with `(diff >= 0.0f) ? diff : -diff` in `compute_si_x10()`. Compiles to VCMP+branch, avoids VABS.F32 entirely.

**File changed:** `src/gait/rolling_window.c:compute_si_x10()`

**Verified:**
- Healthy mode: all 4 profiles SI < 5% (below 10% clinical threshold) ✓
- Pathological mode (true SI = 25%): Flat 17.2%, Bad wear 23.8%, Stairs 19.3%, Slope 22.6% — all above 10% clinical threshold ✓

---

#### BUG-012: rolling_snapshot_t struct size comment wrong (20 bytes stated, 18 bytes actual)

**Symptom:** `parse_binary_export_log()` finds 0 binary snapshots even though `BLE_BINARY_START` is present in the UART log.

**Root cause:** Comment in `rolling_window.h` said `/* 20 bytes */`. Actual layout (4+4+2+2+2+2+1+1) = 18 bytes. The hex line filter in `signal_analysis.py` was checking `len(line) == 40` (20 × 2 hex chars) instead of `len(line) == 36` (18 × 2).

**Fix:** Corrected comment in `rolling_window.h`; changed filter to `len(line) == _SNAPSHOT_STRUCT_SIZE * 2`.

**Impact on hardware:** The production BLE path sends the raw struct over GATT — any host tool must unpack with `struct.Struct("<IIHHHHBb")` (18 bytes), **not** 20 bytes.

---

### Remaining open work before hardware (Stage 4)

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Edge case tests | Zero-step session, FIFO overflow, device flipped upside-down, BLE disconnect mid-export |
| Robot Framework suite | `robot renode/robot/gait_test.robot` — automated Renode regression suite |
| Power model hardware verify | Nordic PPK2 confirmation of ≤5 μA sleep / ≤1.5 mA active (simulation predicts: sleep 5 μA, active 1.1 mA, runtime 344 days on 100 mAh) |

---

## 8. Why This Approach Works

This project was built from zero to a validated embedded gait algorithm — including discovery and fix of a critical clinical safety bug (BUG-013) — without fabricating any hardware.

The key structural principle: **every signal the firmware sees is derived from three first-order physical quantities** (vertical oscillation, cadence, step length), not injected as raw axis values. This means the simulation is a physics test, not a signal playback. When the stair walker produced 0 detected steps, the signal plots immediately showed the biomechanical reason — a 135 ms timing gap that breaks a 40 ms window assumption. No hardware was needed to make this visible.

The secondary principle: **the firmware ELF that runs in Renode is the same binary that gets flashed to the XIAO.** There is no mock, no stub, no model of the algorithm. If a failure mode appears in simulation, it will appear on hardware. If it is resolved in simulation, it is resolved on hardware.

BUG-013 is the proof: a silently-zeroed SI computation that would have shipped as a device reporting "perfect symmetry" for every patient was caught by running a single pathological walker (25% true SI) through the firmware on a virtual Cortex-M4F. No IMU. No patient. No hospital corridor.
